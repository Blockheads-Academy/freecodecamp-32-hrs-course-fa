comment with something you
learned from this course.

5
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:17,550
Welcome to the ultimate solidity
smart contract and blockchain

6
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,940
Developer course, JavaScript
addition, we recently did a

7
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:24,690
version of this video in Python
that has over 2 million views

8
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:28,140
right now making it the most
watched smart contract tutorial

9
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:31,050
on the planet. We've learned a
ton from doing that first

10
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,110
course. And if you love the
Python language, definitely be

11
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:36,600
sure to check that one out.
We've taken all the learnings

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,810
we've got from making that first
course, wrapped it up and put it

13
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:42,780
into this JavaScript video for
you. If you're looking to get

14
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,260
started in web three blockchain
smart contracts or any of these

15
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,310
terms, this is the course for
you. And it's for anybody and

16
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:53,610
everybody, no matter your
experience level in programming

17
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,240
or in blockchain. Ideally, you
know, a little bit of JavaScript

18
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:00,900
before starting this. But if you
don't, no worries, we will help

19
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,390
you along the way. And in case
you do want to learn a little

20
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:05,880
bit of JavaScript before
starting here, there are some

21
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,390
fantastic courses on Free Code
Camp to learn more, but you

22
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:12,720
absolutely don't have to. And
really, any experience with any

23
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,600
object oriented programming
language will work, right. So if

24
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,510
you're brand new to coding, or
if you're brand new to

25
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:22,080
blockchain, this is exactly
where you should be. And if you

26
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,810
already know a lot about
blockchain or coding, this

27
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:29,070
course will give you even more
deep fundamentals on the space.

28
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:32,940
So welcome to the edge of the
rabbit hole. So for those of you

29
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:35,430
who don't know, my name is
Patrick Collins. I'm a smart

30
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:38,490
contract engineer, developer
advocate on the chain link

31
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:43,560
protocol. And I live in breed
smart contracts. I also make

32
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,230
YouTube videos on my own
channel, medium Twitter threads

33
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:49,740
and more. teaching people about
smart contracts about coding and

34
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:53,700
about this new technology. I
love helping developers learn,

35
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:56,910
grow and learn about this new
Advent. That's blockchain and

36
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:59,730
smart contracts. And I'll be
taking you on your journey to

37
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:03,450
becoming a blockchain expert and
Wizard of the smart contract

38
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:06,420
developing world. And even if
you don't want to become a

39
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,710
developer, the first section our
blockchain basics, will give you

40
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:14,040
a lot of fundamental knowledge
about how blockchain and smart

41
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:18,030
contracts, even work. I am so
excited for you to be here. And

42
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:21,480
I hope you enjoy the journey.
This is a data dump, passion

43
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,660
educational project of
everything I've learned working

44
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:28,560
in this space. And I am 100%
certain that if you follow

45
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,650
along, you'll come out the other
side of this, armed with the

46
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:35,130
knowledge to be a positive force
in this incredible industry,

47
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:38,700
solidity and smart contract
developers are massively in

48
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:43,770
demand with an average salary of
being around $145,000 a year,

49
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:47,040
there is massive economic
opportunity from learning this

50
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,820
course. And this technology has
the ability to revolutionize

51
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,270
everything that we interact
with, and you can be one of the

52
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:58,650
pioneers ushering in this new
age. In our courses. We already

53
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:01,710
have a track record of giving
people these educational needs

54
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:04,950
and sending them into their
careers in the blockchain and

55
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:08,370
smart contract space. And we are
going to give you all of the

56
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:11,880
cutting edge tools and how to
use them including working with

57
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:16,830
things like D phi NF TS Dows,
ERC 20s upgradable, smart

58
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:19,590
contracts and more. We're going
to teach you the skills

59
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:22,830
necessary to build defy
applications like Ave synthetics

60
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:27,180
and compound, billion dollar
decentralized applications, or

61
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:30,900
massively successful NFT
projects like crypto punks, or

62
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:35,010
board apes. Dow is like maker
Dow or developer, Dow and any of

63
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:38,040
the amazing things you've seen
in the cryptocurrency world. In

64
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,800
learning these skills, you will
have all these economic

65
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,790
opportunities at your fingertips
and the ability to be a pioneer

66
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:48,120
in completely changing the way
we interact with each other. In

67
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,120
a fundamental way. Building
decentralized smart contract

68
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,810
applications is building a world
that's more accountable a world

69
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:58,260
with unbreakable promises, a
faster, more efficient,

70
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,780
financially free world, a
collaborative community,

71
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:04,080
combining the prowess of
philosophy and technology into a

72
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,100
new system. We'll learn more
about the purpose and the value

73
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:11,280
of smart contracts and
decentralized applications in

74
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:14,490
lesson one of this course, and
why they're so exciting. Finish

75
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:17,460
this course. And you'll be
ready. So again, I want to give

76
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:20,580
a major thank you and a major
kudos to you because you've

77
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:24,300
taken the first step to enter
this realm. So welcome to Web

78
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,850
three. Welcome to the
blockchain. Welcome to smart

79
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,850
contracts. And I'll see you at
the bottom of the rabbit hole.

80
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,540
So let's jump into some best
practices for this course so

81
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,330
that you can learn most
effectively and learn with this

82
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:37,560
course as best you can.

83
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:41,580
You do not want to skip

84
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,910
this part. It'll help you solve
80% of your issue. Now, while

85
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:48,240
going through this course be
100% certain to follow along

86
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,450
with a GitHub repository
associated with this course we

87
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:54,330
have a link in the description
of this video for you to

88
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:58,200
absolutely click on follow along
have open in a tab as you're

89
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,200
doing this because it has all
the code Sam polls, timestamps a

90
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,770
community to interact with and
more, it is going to be your

91
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:07,950
Bible for watching this course.
And yes, we have a Discussions

92
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:10,590
tab. This Discussions tab is a
place where you can ask

93
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:13,770
questions, engage with other
developers who are going through

94
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:17,430
this course as well. Get some
help, and etc. Be sure to say

95
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:20,160
hello and meet other like minded
individuals like yourselves.

96
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:22,770
Now, blockchain and smart
contracts move really quickly.

97
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:25,860
And things are constantly being
updated. So to make sure you're

98
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,320
always up to date with the
latest, when I open up some

99
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,320
documentation, try to open up
the documentation for yourself

100
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,710
as well. And maybe even have the
code sample next to you. And as

101
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:37,620
you're writing code, be sure to
refer back to make sure that you

102
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,990
are keeping pace, and then you
have the most up to date

103
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:43,230
samples, sometimes technology
might change, and there might be

104
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,200
a way to do something a little
bit better. So we have this file

105
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,290
called chronological updates, be
sure that this is the first

106
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:51,720
place to check when you run into
an issue to see if maybe

107
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,390
something was updated that you
missed, it'll be chronologically

108
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:57,180
ordered. So it's easier to find
updates. Basically, this is to

109
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:00,810
say, always refer back to the
GitHub repo first. And if you do

110
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:02,730
to find a mistake, or something
isn't working the way you

111
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:05,190
expected, jump into the
conversation, leave a

112
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:09,420
discussion, leave an issue, ask
questions here, take breaks, I

113
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:13,110
cannot tell you how many people
tried rushing through our entire

114
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:15,780
first course in one setting and
didn't retain as much

115
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:18,480
information, your brain
remembers information much

116
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,390
better if you take breaks. So
every 25 minutes or half an

117
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:24,420
hour, maybe take a five minute
walk. And then every two hours

118
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:27,240
take a much longer break. And if
you really want to make sure

119
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:30,000
something drills in, try to go
back and reflect on what you did

120
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,730
for the lesson prior before
continuing to the next lesson.

121
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:36,720
And at the same time, though,
learn at your own speed. There

122
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,400
is no right speed for this
course. If it takes you a day, a

123
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:45,300
week, a month or even a year, it
doesn't matter. Learn at the

124
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:48,510
pace that's right for you, you
can change the speed at which I

125
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:52,080
talked using the little gear
icon in the YouTube video. If

126
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,620
I'm talking way too fast for
you, you can slow me down. And

127
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:59,460
at the same time, if I'm talking
too slow, you can speed me up,

128
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:02,790
you also don't even have to go
in order. You can bounce around

129
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:05,340
topic to topic, if you don't
want to learn full stack, you

130
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,680
can skip the full stack stuff.
If you don't want to learn

131
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,380
coding, we can skip the coding
stuff. If you only want to go to

132
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:13,380
the advanced stuff, go to the
advanced stuff. You are highly

133
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:16,530
encouraged to pause, come back
and ask questions. The

134
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:18,750
blockchain and smart contract
world is incredibly

135
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:22,560
collaborative. So be sure to use
tools like the discussions tab

136
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,640
of our GitHub repository, asking
questions on Stack Overflow and

137
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:30,450
Aetherium Stack Exchange and
tagging relative technologies,

138
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,120
making issues on different
GitHub repositories that you're

139
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,450
working with jumping into
discord, Reddit, Twitter, and

140
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:39,120
any other place that these
communities and technologies are

141
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,790
congregating. And the reason I'm
putting so much emphasis on

142
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:44,460
these community aspects is that
becoming a solidity and

143
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,940
blockchain engineer is so much
more than just the solidity

144
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:50,850
part. Being comfortable with all
the tools in this space,

145
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,260
including the ones to get help
and to give help are essential

146
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:58,320
to being successful here.
Networking is massive, and it

147
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,110
makes it a ton of fun. As you
continue your journey and you

148
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:03,600
get more advanced and you're
looking for places to meet other

149
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,080
developers. Hackathons are one
of the best places to connect

150
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,200
with other engineers, the
chainlink hackathons eath,

151
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,650
global hackathons, and Dev folio
hackathons are three great

152
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:16,890
hackathon suites to connect. And
no matter where you are in your

153
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:19,680
journey, they're great places to
flex what you've learned.

154
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,350
Alright, so those are some of
the best practices for this

155
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:26,700
course. You're standing at the
edge of the rabbit hole, looking

156
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:30,210
down, peering into the world of
web three and smart contracts

157
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:33,390
and blockchain. If you're like
me want to jump in, you want to

158
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:37,110
keep going further. Let's begin
our journey into the world of

159
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:40,410
smart contracts. And it all
starts with the blockchain

160
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:41,100
basics.

161
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,939
Now, I know you're excited

162
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,880
to get coding. But before we
jump in, we want to learn some

163
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,910
of the fundamentals of
blockchains and smart contracts.

164
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:53,550
Understanding these ideologies
and these basics are so

165
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:56,790
important, because it'll dictate
how you architect your

166
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:59,700
decentralized applications,
learning the basics of

167
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,730
blockchain and solidity is
critical. But if you already

168
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:05,490
know the basics of a blockchain,
feel free to jump into lesson

169
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:05,850
two.

170
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,480
Now, since you're here,

171
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:12,840
you've probably heard of Bitcoin
before. Bitcoin was one of the

172
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:16,230
first protocols to use this
revolutionary technology called

173
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:19,530
blockchain. The Bitcoin white
paper was created by the pseudo

174
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:23,400
anonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, and
outlined how Bitcoin can make

175
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,850
peer to peer transactions. In a
decentralized network. This

176
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:30,030
network was powered by
cryptography, decent Tality, and

177
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:34,020
allowed people to engage in
censorship resistant finance, in

178
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:37,320
a decentralized manner due to
its features, which we'll talk

179
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,770
about in a little bit. People
took to this as a superior

180
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,760
digital store of value, a better
store of value over something

181
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,220
like gold, for example, and
that's why you'll also hear

182
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:51,120
people commonly refer to it as a
digital gold similar to gold.

183
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:54,600
There's a scarce amount or a set
amount of bitcoin available on

184
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,780
the planet, only so much that
you can buy and sell. You can

185
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:00,510
read more about the original
vision in the white A paper

186
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:03,330
we've linked to the white paper
in the GitHub repo associated

187
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:06,420
with this course. Now, this was
an insane breakthrough in a

188
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:09,540
little bit, we're going to learn
exactly how this is all possible

189
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,880
and how this actually works
under the hood. Some people

190
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,240
though, saw this technology and
wanted to take it a little bit

191
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,900
farther, and do even more with
this blockchain technology. And

192
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:22,380
a few years later, a man named
Vitalik Buterin, released a

193
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:26,640
white paper for a new protocol
named Aetherium, which use this

194
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,330
same blockchain infrastructure
with an additional feature. And

195
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:34,200
in 2015, him and a number of
other co founders released the

196
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,050
project Aetherium, where people
could not only make

197
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:40,350
decentralized transactions, but
decentralized agreements,

198
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:43,800
decentralized organizations, and
all these other ways to interact

199
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,740
with each other without a
centralized intermediary or

200
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:50,190
centralized governing force.
Basically, their idea was to

201
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:53,610
take this thing that made
Bitcoin so great, and add

202
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:58,200
decentralized agreements to it,
or smart contracts. And in fact,

203
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:00,810
technically, these smart
contracts weren't even really a

204
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:05,220
new idea. Back in 1994, a man
named Nick Zabo, had actually

205
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:08,310
originally come up with the idea
smart contracts are a set of

206
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:12,240
instructions executed in a
decentralized autonomous way,

207
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:16,440
without the need for a third
party or centralized body to run

208
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,170
them. And they come to life on
these blockchains, or these

209
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:22,350
smart contract platforms, like
Aetherium. And it's the smart

210
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:24,930
contracts that are going to be
the core thing that we're going

211
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:26,940
to be working on in this course,
and that we're going to be

212
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,520
developing, you can think of
smart contracts in the same way

213
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,740
you think of traditional
contracts or traditional

214
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:34,740
agreements. They're just a set
of instructions between parties,

215
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:37,920
except instead of written on pen
and paper or typed up in

216
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,430
Microsoft Word, they are written
in code and embodied on these

217
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:44,190
decentralized blockchain
platforms. And that's also where

218
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:47,130
they're executed. Instead of
being executed by the two

219
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:49,650
parties, or three parties, or
however many parties that are

220
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:53,340
involved. This removes this
centralized issue that we'll

221
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:55,440
talk about more in a bit. This
is one of the main

222
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,200
differentiators between the
Etherium protocol and the

223
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,500
Bitcoin protocol. It's these
smart contracts. Now,

224
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:04,800
technically, bitcoin does have
smart contracts, but they're

225
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,130
intentionally Turing incomplete,
which means they don't have all

226
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:10,290
the functionality that a
programming language would give

227
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:13,230
them. This was an intentional
move by Bitcoin developers.

228
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:17,160
Bitcoin developers viewed
Bitcoin as a store of value

229
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:21,150
versus Aetherium, developers
viewed Aetherium as both a store

230
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:25,260
of value and a utility to
facilitate these decentralized

231
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:28,230
agreements. Now, the smart
contracts on blockchains alone

232
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:31,320
are absolutely incredible.
However, they do come with a

233
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,740
huge issue. If we want these
digital agreements to replace

234
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:37,470
the agreements in our everyday
lives, they probably are going

235
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:40,560
to need data from the real world
blockchains by themselves

236
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,280
actually can't interact with and
can't read or listen to data

237
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:47,220
from the real world. This is
what's known as the Oracle

238
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:50,100
problem. These blockchains are
deterministic systems and

239
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,740
they're deterministic on
purpose. And we'll learn about

240
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:55,830
more about how that works in the
sessions to come. So everything

241
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:58,620
that happens with them happens
in their little world. But if

242
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,480
they're going to be these
agreements, they need external

243
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,330
data and they need external
computation. And this is where

244
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,090
Oracle's come into play.
Oracle's are any device that

245
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:09,360
delivers data to these
decentralized blockchain or runs

246
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,660
external computation. However,
if we want our applications to

247
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:17,040
stay truly decentralized, we
can't work with a single Oracle

248
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:20,040
or a single data provider or a
single source that's running

249
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:24,060
these external computations. So
we need a decentralized Oracle

250
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,970
network. Similar to our
decentralized blockchain

251
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:29,730
network, you're on chain logic
will be decentralized, but you

252
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,610
also need your off chain data
and computation be

253
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:36,780
decentralized, combining this on
chain decentralized logic. With

254
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:39,300
this off chain, decentralized
data and decentralized

255
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,720
computation gives rise to
something called hybrid smart

256
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,930
contracts. And most of the
biggest protocols that we

257
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:49,830
interact with today are some
type of hybrid smart contract or

258
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:52,440
interact with hybrid smart
contracts. To some extent, this

259
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,200
is where the protocol chaining
comes into play. It is a

260
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,830
modular, decentralized Oracle
network that can both bring

261
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:02,400
external data and external
computation into our smart

262
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,730
contracts to make sure they're
decentralized end to end, while

263
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:09,780
giving them the feature richness
that we need for our agreements.

264
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:13,500
chainlink allows for us to get
data to upkeeps, get random

265
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,530
numbers or really customize our
smart contracts in any

266
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:18,900
meaningful way. Now, throughout
the course, we're going to use

267
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:22,560
the terminology smart contract.
However, whenever we say smart

268
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,010
contract, we're often using it a
little interchangeably with

269
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,920
hybrid smart contracts, but just
know that when we say hybrid

270
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:32,040
smart contract, we're talking
specifically about smart

271
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:35,430
contracts that have some type of
off chain component. Now since

272
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:37,890
the theorems release, a number
of different block chains or

273
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:41,490
smart contract platforms have
come to light such as avalanche

274
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:45,420
polygon, Phantom harmony, and
more. For the majority of this

275
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,460
course, we're going to be
assuming that we're going to be

276
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:50,580
deploying to the Ethereum
network. However, everything

277
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:53,280
that we learned here is going to
be applicable to the vast

278
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:56,520
majority of the blockchains out
there like polygon, avalanche,

279
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:59,310
Phantom harmony, etc, and
understanding everything from a

280
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:01,890
theory and funding mentals will
give you the skills that you

281
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:05,670
need to switch chains very
easily with literally one line

282
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:08,760
of code. So don't worry about
learning a specific tool or with

283
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:12,600
a specific chain because most of
them work together seamlessly.

284
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:15,090
Now, there are a couple of smart
contract platforms that don't

285
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:18,360
use solidity. But still learning
the fundamentals here will make

286
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,420
you much better at those as
well. And the Etherium by far

287
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,300
has the most value locked and is
the most used blockchain and

288
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,700
smart contract platform out
there. You'll also hear those

289
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,190
two terms used a little bit
interchangeably as well.

290
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,380
Sometimes they'll say smart
contract platform, sometimes

291
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,960
they'll say blockchain, they
kind of mean the same thing.

292
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,530
Obviously, blockchains could
mean store of value and smart

293
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:41,070
contract platform, but you get
the idea. Similarly, chainlink

294
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:44,640
is the most popular and powerful
decentralized Oracle network is

295
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,950
the one that we're going to be
focusing on for this course as

296
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:50,400
well. chainlink is also
blockchain agnostic. So to work

297
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:54,540
on Aetherium, avalanche, Polygon
Solana Terra, or really any

298
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,880
other blockchain out there. Now,
throughout this course, you'll

299
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,390
hear the term DAP or
decentralized Protocol, or smart

300
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:03,540
contract Protocol, or
decentralized application. And

301
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:06,060
they all kind of mean the same
thing. A decentralized

302
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:08,970
application is usually the
combination of many smart

303
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:11,850
contracts. And when we get into
solidity, you'll see what a

304
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:14,820
singular smart contract really
looks like. And like I said,

305
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:17,520
learning all these core
fundamentals will make you a

306
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,640
better solidity and a better
smart contract developer, you'll

307
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:24,000
also hear the term web three a
lot in this video. And in the

308
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,700
industry, web three is the idea
that blockchain and smart

309
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:30,810
contracts are the next iteration
of the web web one being this

310
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:34,950
permissionless open source world
with static content, web two

311
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:37,980
being the permissioned web with
dynamic content, but all the

312
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:41,610
agreements and logic runs off of
centralized servers where they

313
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:44,490
control your information. And
then web three comes back to the

314
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:48,450
permissionless web. But once
again, with dynamic content, and

315
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:50,790
instead of centralized servers,
running your logic,

316
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,480
decentralized networks, run the
logic creating these censorship

317
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:58,080
resistant agreements, that the
smart contracts enable is also

318
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:01,170
generally accompanied by the
idea that the users own the

319
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:04,080
protocols that they work with,
and it's an ownership economy.

320
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,390
You'll see what I mean later in
this course. And we've talked a

321
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:09,000
lot about the history and about
the high level of these

322
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,030
protocols and of the smart
contracts and what they can do.

323
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,630
But what do these smart
contracts really mean? What is

324
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:18,960
it when I say trust, minimize
agreements or unbreakable

325
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:23,130
promises? What is the real value
add of these smart contracts?

326
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:25,830
Before we look under the hood,
take a peek at how this all

327
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:29,400
works. From a technical
standpoint. Let's learn what all

328
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,340
the value of this is. What is
the purpose of us building all

329
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:35,310
these technologies? Have you
taken this course? What problem

330
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:38,850
does this technology solve? In
my mind, a technology is really

331
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:41,910
only as good as the problem that
it solves. If it doesn't solve a

332
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:45,960
problem, then why bother Mark
contracts, Blockchain web three

333
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,750
cryptocurrencies, those are all
just different words that

334
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:52,140
encapsulate the idea of what
we're doing in such a unique

335
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:55,860
paradigm. I think the easiest
way to sum up what these smart

336
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:59,970
contracts do is that they create
trust minimized agreements. And

337
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:02,640
if you might be scratching your
head to that. A much easier way

338
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,360
to think about it is just that
give rise to unbreakable

339
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:10,410
promises. Yes, you heard that
right. Unbreakable agreements

340
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:13,860
and promises. Additionally, they
give rise to speed, efficiency

341
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:17,130
and transparency, and a number
of other things. I made a video

342
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:21,150
pretty recently about exactly
this. So let's dive in and take

343
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:24,150
a listen to the purpose the
undeniable value

344
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:30,030
of smart contracts
cryptocurrencies, fundamentally

345
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:33,330
re landscape markets and
agreements as we know them.

346
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:36,060
Unfortunately, you've probably
only been bombarded with people

347
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:38,610
screaming about empties and
money. Now, some of the memes

348
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:41,070
are fun, but let's forget the
bullet and get down to the

349
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:44,400
essence of the space. If you're
already in web three. This is

350
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,280
the video to send to your
friends to explain why you're so

351
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,550
excited about this space and
explain why we're here. And then

352
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:53,010
if you're not into crypto,
you've come to the right place.

353
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:55,890
And yes, there are fun memes and
markets and there's some money

354
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:58,740
stuff in there all these things.
But outside of all that the

355
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:02,790
purpose of blockchains relates
to the age old elementary school

356
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:07,710
unbreakable, promise the pinky
swear, let's get Froggy. Nearly

357
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:10,860
everything you do in life is the
result of an agreement or a

358
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:14,100
contract. Your chair was the
result of an agreement to buy

359
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,770
and sell lumber to assemble and
sell the chair to a real tailor

360
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:19,860
on Amazon. Then you made an
agreement to buy the chair for

361
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:23,400
$40. The lights in your house
are powered by electricity,

362
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:25,680
which is an agreement from you
and the electric company you

363
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:28,170
agree to pay them in return
they'll keep the lights on the

364
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:30,810
electricity they generate it's
agreements between them and

365
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:33,990
engineers who built turbines to
generate the electricity with

366
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:36,570
insurance you agree to pay some
amount of money to them every

367
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:39,870
month, and in return, they will
do nothing or I mean, they'll

368
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:43,530
cover your medical bills, almost
everything you do and everything

369
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:46,860
you interact with is the result
of some form of agreement or

370
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:50,190
contract in some aspect. Now,
agreements and contracts can

371
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:54,180
feel kind of abstract and boring
to really grasp on to simplify,

372
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:57,120
we can also refer to them as
promises. When you get an oil

373
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,760
change. They're promising that
they will faithfully change your

374
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,090
oil In exchange for money, when
you put money in the bank, they

375
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:06,390
promise to keep it safe in
exchange for them to use your

376
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:09,240
money to give out loans. When
you buy a lottery ticket, the

377
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,360
lottery promises to give you a
fair chance at winning a ton of

378
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,330
money in exchange for you buying
the ticket. Whenever you make

379
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:19,050
one of these agreements. In a
way, you're asking them to pinky

380
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:22,590
swear to not screw you over and
to treat you fairly. But this

381
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:25,500
doesn't always happen. Let's
look at a real world example of

382
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:28,590
someone breaking the Pinkie
swear back in the 80s and 90s,

383
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:30,810
McDonald's ran a promotion for
people to win money by

384
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:33,930
collecting McDonald's Monopoly
game cards. The idea was simple.

385
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,870
You buy McDonald's in return,
you get a chance to win $1

386
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:41,130
million. You can imagine
McDonald's literally going Hey,

387
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:44,160
everybody, I promise you if you
buy our MC food and McNuggets,

388
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:48,450
we'll give you a fair chance of
winning this money, we ended up

389
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:50,910
breaking this promise, instead
of having a fair chance of

390
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:56,040
winning your chance was in fact,
zero in the mid 90s. Between 13

391
00:20:56,040 --> 00:21:00,330
and $24 million went into the
pockets of not people playing

392
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:03,420
the game, honestly. But a group
of corrupt insiders who had

393
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:06,270
rigged the game, meaning that
when you played the McDonald's

394
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:09,630
Monopoly game, you were buying
into a set of lies and promises

395
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:13,890
that were 100% always going to
be broken. And the thing is, it

396
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:16,470
doesn't really matter if this
was McDonald's fault or not.

397
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,020
They were the ones making the
promises that they ultimately

398
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,540
could not keep. Another way you
could think about it is that

399
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:26,130
that's $24 million that they
essentially stole from you and I

400
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:30,480
now if this system was deployed
on a blockchain was something

401
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,080
called a smart contract, it
would have been impossible to

402
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:39,690
defraud this $24 million due to
smart contracts being immutable,

403
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,750
decentralized and transparent.
But I'll get back to that in a

404
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:47,430
minute. In all the agreements
and contracts we make, imagine

405
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:51,000
making a pinky swear with a 10
year old and imagining how that

406
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,280
agreement would hold up. Hey,
buddy, Could you could you

407
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,500
please keep my money safe? You
can play with it if you like,

408
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:58,680
but just please have it when I
come back. Immediately. You

409
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,050
might get that worrying feeling
in your chest, something might

410
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:03,660
go wrong. This 10 year old might
lose your money. You might be

411
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:07,380
thinking, how could I trust
them? Will they break their

412
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:10,770
promise and this feeling of I
can't breathe because of

413
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:14,580
untrustworthy situations
happens? Once all the time. Can

414
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,860
I trust this used car
salesperson to give me a good

415
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:20,190
car? Can I trust this tag that
says machine washable? Or will

416
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:22,620
it make my shirt shrink? Will my
insurance provider break their

417
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:25,800
promise of covering my medical
bills want to get hit by a bus?

418
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:28,830
I'm Patrick promises he'll go on
a hike with me. Well, he

419
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:32,400
actually I actually will. But
the issue with our current

420
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,430
agreements and contracts is we
have to trust the people. We're

421
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:38,310
making them to do the right
thing. However often they're

422
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:41,520
actually incentivized to not do
the right thing. insurance

423
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,580
doesn't want to pay out money.
Sometimes salespeople just want

424
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:47,400
to get the shit off the shelves
and with my girlfriend, I

425
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,790
promised to go on a hike. But I
need hikes. Where else is has

426
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:52,950
happened. Now you might be
thinking okay, Patrick, this

427
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:56,370
seems cool. But like Where has
this actually affected me? Well,

428
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:59,010
the McDonald's lottery that we
just spoke about above during

429
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:01,710
the Great Depression with the
run of the banks banks promised

430
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:04,560
to keep our money safe and that
when we went back to go get it

431
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:07,920
they would actually have the
money there. And well and behold

432
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,200
there were times that they
didn't have the money they're

433
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:14,250
just last year Robin Hood
painted this amazing picture. On

434
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:17,340
user application we will give
you access to the markets we

435
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:22,470
promise we will give you a
retail investor a fair chance of

436
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,420
interacting with the world the
finance

437
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:29,520
side, but not this asset. This
asset, this asset or this asset,

438
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:33,030
the 2008 financial crisis
remember that shady deals behind

439
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:35,580
closed doors combined with lies
about financial product brought

440
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:39,420
the world to its economic knees,
how are you? hyperinflation in

441
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:42,600
Zimbabwe hyperinflation in
Brazil, fair enough. US history

442
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:46,470
is a relentless lesson of
trustworthy entities being

443
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,740
notorious promised breakers and
we finally have a way to fix it

444
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:52,530
with smart contracts. Now,
before I jump into smart

445
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:56,220
contracts, a lot of people might
be thinking, hey, cool in all,

446
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:59,790
however, we have systems in
place to protect against a lot

447
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:03,030
of these things, which is true,
and which is great. And that is

448
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:06,780
a very helpful step forward. But
these systems often breaks ones

449
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:09,570
in 2008 Definitely didn't work.
The ones with the Robin Hood

450
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:12,870
crisis definitely didn't work.
And even if these systems apply,

451
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:15,960
and you go to court to try to
work them out, maybe you're in

452
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,990
court for years before you
actually see a resolution and by

453
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:23,310
that time, what you needed the
money for is longer. So what is

454
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:26,460
this technology? What is this
tool that can fix this

455
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:30,000
fundamental problem in our
agreements today, this tool is

456
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,660
smart contracts and this tool is
what the blockchain was built

457
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:36,540
for. Now, I'm gonna give you a
quick overview of what a smart

458
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:39,030
contract is. However, I'm
leaving some links in the

459
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:42,420
description for more in depth
explanations, but the basics of

460
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:46,050
them is a smart contract is an
agreement contract or a set of

461
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:49,680
instructions deployed on a
decentralized blockchain. And

462
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:52,830
once the contract or set of
instructions is deployed, it

463
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:56,100
cannot be altered, it
automatically executes and

464
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:59,340
everyone can see the terms of
the agreement. Real basics of it

465
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:02,940
is that the code is executed by
decentralized collective like a

466
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:05,130
group of people but a group of
people running a certain

467
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:08,760
software. This means that no one
person or entity can actually

468
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:11,460
alter any of these agreements or
change the terms of the

469
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:14,760
arrangement in these traditional
agreements. Whoever owns the

470
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:17,370
contract, whoever owns the
execution of the contract can

471
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:20,910
flip a switch and say, We're not
going to do that anymore. In

472
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:24,120
smart contracts and web three in
blockchain, you no longer can do

473
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,880
that. Typically, these smart
contracts are on a decentralized

474
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,670
blockchain, and used in
combination with a decentralized

475
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:32,730
Oracle network to get the real
world assets and information.

476
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:35,220
And if these words sound like
I'm conjuring up a magic spell,

477
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:37,410
well, again, check the links in
the description. If you want to

478
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:39,750
learn more about the technical
implications. If you're not a

479
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:41,730
technical person, then you're
not interested in getting into

480
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:45,330
the nitty gritty, you can kind
of think of it like HTTPS, I bet

481
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:48,390
the vast majority of you don't
even know what HTTPS stands for.

482
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:51,060
And yet you use it every single
day whenever you log on to the

483
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:53,940
internet. So how does this fix
the McDonald's Monopoly issue?

484
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:57,540
In its traditional form, the
lottery was executed behind

485
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:01,290
closed doors, somebody operated
and owned the code and the

486
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:03,870
contracts and the agreements
that ran the lottery, and they

487
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:07,200
had the power to alter it. And
nobody other than the people

488
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,740
internal on the lottery could
audit this altering happening.

489
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:14,940
Now if the code for this lottery
was deployed onto a blockchain,

490
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,150
every time a hacker attempted to
alter it, everyone would be

491
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:21,300
notified. Not only that, but you
couldn't even alter it, because

492
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,790
the terms of a smart contract
cannot be altered. Once

493
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:26,670
deployed, combine that smart
contract with a chain link VRF

494
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:30,360
Oracle to get a verifiably
random number. And presto, you

495
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:33,120
now have a perfectly
decentralized, unalterable

496
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,420
agreement that is impossible to
hack commit fraud or manipulate

497
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:40,740
we have just saved the public
between 13,000,020 $4 million

498
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:46,050
just by fixing the issue of
trust. How does this fix Robin

499
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:48,480
Hood? Well, the problem with
Robin Hood is already fixed.

500
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:51,360
Right? Again, the problem is
that there's a centralized body

501
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,380
that can flip a switch at any
time and say you can't access

502
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:58,290
these markets anymore. We're
breaking our promise of actually

503
00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:01,260
giving you access to the
markets. This is already fixed

504
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:03,390
with something called
decentralized exchanges. And

505
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:07,080
these exist today, one of these
exchanges is one called uniswap.

506
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:10,320
You can swap ERC 20 tokens,
which are kind of the equivalent

507
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,200
of stocks, but some are some
are, it's a little confusing. I

508
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,810
won't get into that here either.
But it doesn't have that

509
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:19,620
centralized body that can flip a
switch and ruin access to the

510
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:22,860
markets. And had these investors
been on a decentralized

511
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:26,730
exchange, it would have saved
them hundreds of millions of

512
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:29,010
dollars, and it would have
prevented fraudulent market

513
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:31,530
manipulation. How does it fix
run of the banks with

514
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:34,470
transparency built in an
automated solvency checks, you

515
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:37,050
can build a bank like smart
contract that has insolvency

516
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:39,840
checks built in that make it
impossible to get there and

517
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:44,190
solve it means brokers any
agreement or any history lesson,

518
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:46,890
where there was a trust
assumption that was broken,

519
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:50,850
smart contracts can be applied
to and should be applied to,

520
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:54,480
especially in a time where big
money runs, owns and controls

521
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,350
everything, we desperately need
to move to a world where some

522
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:01,620
self interested centralized
entity can't flip a switch and

523
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:04,680
ruin people's access to the
services that they need. We can

524
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:08,640
move away from a world that is
brand based to a world that is

525
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:11,940
math based. Right now, if you
interact with a service that you

526
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:15,330
don't like, or that they break
their promise, the only thing

527
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:18,330
you can do is walk down the
street to the next service

528
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:20,700
that's going to make the same
set of promises. And you have to

529
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,160
hope and pray that they're
actually going to keep it we can

530
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:26,520
move from that to a world where
we can just look at the map and

531
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:29,580
say, oh, okay, one plus one
equals two. This is what this

532
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:33,690
agreement is going to do for me
every single time guaranteed,

533
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:36,750
because it's a decentralized
autonomous agent has no

534
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:39,570
incentive to be evil, and
everything is transparent and

535
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:42,060
out in the open of a big
company. And if it was better

536
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:45,480
for me for one plus one to equal
three, maybe I would go behind

537
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:48,060
some closed doors and flood some
numbers and come back and be

538
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:51,570
like, hey, one plus one equals
three with smart contracts.

539
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,680
That's impossible. Doing the
right thing is infrastructural

540
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:58,770
now, given the choice between
two agreements, one where you

541
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:01,530
have to trust a single
centralized entity that they're

542
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:05,400
going to do the right thing for
you, versus a decentralized

543
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:07,170
untampered double collective,

544
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:09,840
which one you're gonna choose.
I'm picking the one that can't

545
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:14,010
screw me over every single time.
For every agreement I can apply

546
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:17,160
it to now this technology is
relatively new, but we have

547
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:20,550
already seen it relandscaping
entire markets and continue to

548
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:23,700
do so the traditional financial
world is already getting its

549
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:27,660
lunch eaten by defy or
decentralized finance. There's

550
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:30,990
already over $200 billion of
people's money in these

551
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:34,260
protocols to help have a more
fair, more accountable, more

552
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:37,530
transparent financial system.
This defy movement is one of the

553
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:40,530
main reasons I got into this
space because we desperately

554
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:44,550
need to move away from where we
are right now. And and people's

555
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:47,850
chances for wealth being sucked
up by some group that's bending

556
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:50,700
the rules in their favor and
smart contracts are our ticket

557
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:53,790
to that better world. More and
more industries are also coming

558
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:56,010
over to smart contracts and
blockchain because of all the

559
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:59,280
innovations and because of all
the advantages that it has as we

560
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:02,220
grow and as we get better as we
get closer to this vision of

561
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:06,690
having this concept fulfilled,
trust minimized agreements.

562
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:09,660
These smart contracts are
minimizing the trust that we

563
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:12,600
need to give other people in
order for these agreements to be

564
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:15,150
executed. If trust minimized
agreements is too confusing for

565
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:18,630
you just say unbreakable
promises. Now I gotta be honest

566
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:21,090
with you guys. blockchains and
smart contracts and

567
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:23,460
cryptocurrencies can actually do
more than just trust, minimize

568
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:26,820
agreements. They have security
benefits, uptime benefits,

569
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:29,340
execution, speed benefits, and a
whole lot more. But it's a lot

570
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:31,620
easier to just learn about one
and learn the other ones later,

571
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:34,260
right. It's kind of like
sprinkles on top. So this is why

572
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,990
we are here. This is why we're
building this future and this is

573
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:39,390
why we are so excited about it.

574
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,440
Even in just this introduction
part, we've learned a ton. So

575
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:49,680
let's do a quick summary of what
we've learned so far. Bitcoin

576
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:53,070
was the first protocol to take
this blockchain technology into

577
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:55,500
the limelight and take these
cryptocurrencies into the

578
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:59,400
mainstream Bitcoin is a sort of
digital gold or a store of value

579
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:02,730
able to make transactions
between users in a decentralized

580
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:05,130
manner. Aetherium and other
smart contract platforms take

581
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:08,640
this blockchain technology one
step further, enabling people to

582
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,550
make smart contracts and
decentralized trust minimized

583
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:14,760
agreements, the smart contracts
and decentralized applications

584
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,120
can access and interact with the
real world using something

585
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:21,090
called decentralized Oracle
networks. chain link is a

586
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:24,060
decentralized network that
allows us to build these hybrid

587
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:28,830
smart contracts, which combines
our on chain logic with our off

588
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:31,950
chain, decentralized data, and
decentralized computation,

589
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:35,220
giving rise to our logic being
completely decentralized, and

590
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:37,890
our data and external
computation being completely

591
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:41,280
decentralized, giving us all the
features that traditional

592
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:44,190
agreements and traditional
contracts have. Now these

593
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:46,860
digital currencies like
Aetherium, and Bitcoin have

594
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:50,070
value. Even without the smart
contract part, having a

595
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:53,310
censorship resistant,
decentralized store of value is

596
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:56,130
naturally powerful in its own
right, we have some links in the

597
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:58,680
GitHub repository that will
teach you how this decentralized

598
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:02,010
store of value flips traditional
finance on its head. And it's

599
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:04,650
another one of the great reasons
for building smart contracts.

600
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:08,460
But again, the easiest way to
boil it down is trust minimized

601
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:11,430
agreements, or unbreakable
promises. But let's also go into

602
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,830
some of these other features
that smart contracts have over

603
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:16,500
our traditional environment. The
first feature, of course, is

604
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,230
that they are decentralized. And
they have no centralized

605
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:21,840
intermediary, the different
individuals that run one of

606
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,870
these blockchains are known as
node operators. And it's the

607
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:28,500
combination of all these 1000s
of node operators running the

608
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:31,260
same software running these
algorithms running these smart

609
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:34,800
contracts that make the network
decentralized. We'll dive deeper

610
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:38,010
into how that works later. The
next feature is transparency and

611
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:40,890
flexibility in these
decentralized networks. Since

612
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:44,010
all these individual node
operators run the software,

613
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:47,010
everybody can see everything
that's happening on chain,

614
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:49,620
meaning there's no shady deals,
there's no weird things

615
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:53,550
happening. Anything that's going
to be unfair, people will be

616
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:56,790
able to see and just not use,
everybody has perfect

617
00:32:56,790 --> 00:33:00,150
information and has to play by
the same rules. Now

618
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:03,060
additionally, this doesn't mean
that there's no privacy, the

619
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:05,820
blockchain is pseudo anonymous,
meaning that you aren't

620
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:09,660
necessarily tied to an identity
in real life, they also have the

621
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:12,480
feature of speed and efficiency.
For those of you who have ever

622
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,020
tried to do a bank transfer or
send money across seas, you

623
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:19,620
know, it sometimes can take two
to three weeks, when in fact,

624
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:22,950
all these banks are really doing
is basic math. They're

625
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:26,130
subtracting money from your
balance and adding it to some

626
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:29,580
other balance. Why does it take
so long, in the blockchain, all

627
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:33,030
of these transactions happen
instantly. Another instance for

628
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:35,850
those in the financial world
today know that clearing houses

629
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:39,090
and settlement days can take a
long time. In the blockchain,

630
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:42,090
there's no need for any of that,
because they happen instantly.

631
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:45,270
This obviously is much quicker,
but it also makes for much more

632
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:48,960
efficient interactions with each
other security and immutability.

633
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:52,800
Again, immutable means that it
can't be changed. Once a smart

634
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:56,460
contract is deployed, that's it,
whatever is in the code is going

635
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:59,430
to be in the code forever, they
cannot be altered or tampered

636
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:02,550
with in any way. This means that
the security is much easier.

637
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:04,860
Whereas in a centralized world,
somebody can hack into the

638
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:08,010
server, jump into the database
and change some numbers. You

639
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:10,380
can't do that in the blockchain
world. And since it's

640
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:13,710
decentralized, in order to hack
the blockchain, you'd have to

641
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:17,430
take over half of the nodes as
opposed to in the centralized

642
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:20,520
world, where you only have to
take over one in the regular

643
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:23,910
world. If your computer and your
backup computer go down, all of

644
00:34:23,910 --> 00:34:27,540
your data is gone. In the
blockchain world, if your

645
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:30,660
computer and your backup
computer go down, all your data

646
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:34,500
is safe, because it's being run
on all these other decentralized

647
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:38,190
nodes. And even if a few 100
nodes or a few 1000 nodes go

648
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:41,550
down. It doesn't matter because
as long as one node has a copy

649
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:45,240
of the blockchain, you're good
to go hacking a blockchain is

650
00:34:45,390 --> 00:34:49,140
nearly impossible, and leaps and
bounds more difficult than

651
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:52,290
hacking a centralized server.
Not only that, but this is safer

652
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,010
in the asset sense as well. All
you need to access your

653
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:59,760
credentials and your information
in your assets is your private

654
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:03,300
key. Which is basically your
password for all of this. And as

655
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:06,000
we've discussed in the video,
the smart contracts remove this

656
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,540
counterparty risk, remove this
centralized intermediary, remove

657
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:13,050
these trust gateways that we
have to do in web two. When we

658
00:35:13,050 --> 00:35:15,960
engage with users and
individuals, they don't always

659
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:19,230
have our best interests at heart
smart contracts, remove this

660
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:21,600
counterparty risk, because once
one of these contracts is

661
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,840
created, they can't go in and
they can't alter it. And they

662
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:27,390
can't let greed or ego or
anything else, get the better of

663
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:30,630
them and alter the terms of the
deal. And as we said, this gives

664
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:34,440
rise to these trust minimized
agreements or these programmatic

665
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:38,400
unbreakable promises. We move
away from brand based agreements

666
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:41,400
to math based agreements, where
we can look at the cryptography

667
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:44,970
we can look right at the code
and see exactly what something

668
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:47,880
is going to do and how it's
going to execute, versus having

669
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:51,000
to rely on a human being doing
the right thing with smart

670
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,510
contracts and decentralized
hybrid smart contracts. Doing

671
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:57,750
the right thing is
infrastructural all these pieces

672
00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:01,020
boil down to us having the
freedom to interact the way we

673
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:04,590
want to interact without having
to be afraid that interacting

674
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:07,590
like that is going to screw us
over this trust minimized piece,

675
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:12,420
these unbreakable promises, make
interactions so much better. In

676
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:15,270
a purely web two world, we're
constantly bombarded with

677
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:19,410
messages of projects and
protocols pushing us to move or

678
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:22,620
act in the direction that makes
them more profitable. Versus in

679
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:23,820
the smart contract space,

680
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:26,460
we can see everything
transparently. And we can even

681
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:29,970
engage in interact and be
partially owners of the

682
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:33,360
protocols and the interactions
that we decide that we want to

683
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:33,750
be a part

684
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:38,700
of. So smart contracts have

685
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:41,850
been around for a few years now.
And what did they generate for

686
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:44,640
what industries have come about
due to these smart contract

687
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,950
platforms being around? Well,
you've probably heard of some of

688
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:49,020
these and some of these we've
already mentioned, but let's

689
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:52,530
give you a quick refresher, d
phi d phi stands for

690
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:56,010
decentralized finance. And it
gives users the ability to

691
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:58,950
engage with finance and markets
without having to go through a

692
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:01,500
centralized intermediary. For
example, like we said, with

693
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:04,290
Robin Hood, you no longer have
to trust that Robin Hood would

694
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:07,350
continue to give you access to
the markets, you instead would

695
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:10,290
be able to see in the smart
contract. Yes, I have access to

696
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:13,320
the markets or in the 2008
financial crisis. You never have

697
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:16,530
to trust that these groups and
institutions are giving you the

698
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:19,230
correct things on the back end.
You can see everything

699
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:22,440
transparently right on the
blockchain, you can engage with

700
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,590
things like money markets and
sophisticated financial products

701
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:30,090
easy effectively and securely at
the time of recording. defi has

702
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:34,500
around $200 billion in assets
under management and is quickly

703
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:37,860
growing. If you're really
excited about defy we have a ton

704
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:40,650
of defy examples showing you how
to build and interact with these

705
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:43,920
protocols. In coming lessons.
Dows or decentralized.

706
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:46,620
autonomous organizations are
another group that we've already

707
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:49,650
mentioned. Dows are groups that
are governed completely

708
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:52,770
decentralized by a set of
instructions or smart contracts

709
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,130
on chain. There are some massive
benefits here where engagement

710
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:58,770
is much easier. The rules are
black and white. And you can see

711
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:01,200
everything directly on chain
voting and governance

712
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,050
technologies completely
decentralized in the blockchain

713
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:06,840
space is one of the big ones
pushing how we can evolve

714
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:09,360
politics and how we can evolve
governance to make it more

715
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:12,450
efficient, fair and reasonable.
And you better know it, we have

716
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:15,120
some examples of how to build
Dows and how to work with Dows

717
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:18,990
incoming lessons. So be sure to
watch those NF T's Stanford non

718
00:38:18,990 --> 00:38:22,860
fungible tokens and can really
be kind of described as digital

719
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:26,850
art or just a unique asset, they
can do so much more, but we'll

720
00:38:26,850 --> 00:38:29,250
keep it high level for now.
Projects like board apes and

721
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:32,760
crypto punks have revolutionized
the way that people get paid for

722
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,670
their work, show off their
creativity, status, and so much

723
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:38,730
more. And yes, of course, we
have lessons showing you how to

724
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:42,060
create and interact with NF T's
as well, so many other groups

725
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:44,880
and so many other industries are
being created as a result of

726
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,850
this insane technology. And
maybe after finishing the

727
00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:51,450
journey with us here, you go out
and you'd be the one to pioneer

728
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:54,960
the next industry or the next
billion dollar idea you've

729
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,290
learned so much already. But now
that we've learned a lot of this

730
00:38:58,290 --> 00:39:02,700
high level information, let's
finally jump in, and let's make

731
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:06,450
your first transaction and let's
get you set up to interact with

732
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:09,120
this new world. In this next
section, we're going to get you

733
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:12,720
a wallet and we're going to show
you exactly what a transaction

734
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:20,310
looks like and feels like. Let's
dive in. This is the Aetherium

735
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:24,840
website aetherium.org We are
going to make a transaction on a

736
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:28,050
test Aetherium blockchain I'll
explain what that means in a

737
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:31,170
little bit. This is going to be
our first transaction that's

738
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:34,710
made on the blockchain. Now
again, this process that we're

739
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:38,100
going to follow is going to work
the exact same with polygon,

740
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:41,970
avalanche Phantom and all these
other EVM compatible

741
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:44,730
blockchains. I'll explain what
that means in a bit too. For

742
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:47,820
now, just follow along and have
fun in order to make a

743
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:50,970
transaction on any of these
blockchains. The first thing

744
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:55,110
that we need to do is we need to
set up a wallet. So I'm gonna go

745
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:57,810
ahead and go to meta mask
because it's one of the most

746
00:39:57,810 --> 00:40:00,930
popular wallets and one of the
easiest to Use, we're going to

747
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:03,870
go ahead and download it. I'm
using the brave browser, but it

748
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:07,740
works for Chrome, Firefox or
really any other browsers. And

749
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:11,070
it's just going to be a little
extension in the top right hand

750
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:14,910
of your browser. This way, we
can really easily see it any

751
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:17,730
times what we have in our
wallet, will still are all of

752
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:21,240
our Aetherium based currencies.
So I'm gonna go ahead and

753
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,950
install meta mask for brave,

754
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:27,930
add to brave, add extension. And
now we can go ahead and get

755
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:31,500
started with working with Brave,
this is the first step you

756
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:34,170
absolutely need to take when
starting your journey and one of

757
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:36,750
the easiest steps to take. So
we're gonna go ahead and get

758
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:40,050
started. And we're going to
create a brand new wallet. So

759
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:42,840
we're gonna go ahead and hit
create wallet. If you already

760
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:46,830
have a wallet, you can actually
import it via I have a seed

761
00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:49,680
phrase, and we'll talk about the
seed phrase or secret phrase in

762
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:53,460
a little bit. So let's go ahead
and create a new wallet. And

763
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:56,640
sure, we'll agree to help out
Metamask now we will create our

764
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:00,660
password make sure that this is
really secure. For the purpose

765
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:03,300
of this demo, my passwords are
just gonna be password. But

766
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:06,060
please don't have that be your
password. You may also get a

767
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:08,760
video like this teaching you
about your secret recovery

768
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:12,120
phrase. This is the same thing
as your pneumonic. But see your

769
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:15,420
recovery phrase is a lot more
clear as to what it is. And

770
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:17,820
again, to give us a ton of
different tips on how to

771
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:21,630
actually store it and keep it
safe. The main takeaway from

772
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:24,960
this is never shared this
absolutely never shared this. So

773
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:28,140
we're going to go ahead and
click reveal secret words. I'm

774
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:31,470
showing you guys here because
this is just a demo and I don't

775
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:35,250
really care. However, if you
show this secret phrase to

776
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:38,820
anybody else, they will have
access to all the funds in your

777
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:41,460
application. So everything that
we're going to do in this

778
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:43,980
tutorial, we're going to use
fake money, we're going to use

779
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:47,340
not real money, so it doesn't
matter. Now for the purposes of

780
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:51,270
testing and developing, I always
recommend using a completely

781
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:54,750
separate meta mask, a completely
separate Wallet. So for going

782
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:57,870
throughout this entire course,
if you already have a wallet, or

783
00:41:57,870 --> 00:42:01,080
if you already have a meta mask,
please just set up a new one,

784
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:04,020
create a new profile, create a
new meta mask, and this will be

785
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:06,600
your wallet that you use for the
duration of this course.

786
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:09,000
However, if you're going to
actually put money in here, you

787
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,310
absolutely need to have this
written down. Because if you

788
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:14,160
lose access to this, and all
your private keys, which we'll

789
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:17,370
talk about in a little bit, you
will lose access to your wallet,

790
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:20,310
and you will lose access to all
your funds. So they give some

791
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:23,190
tips like store this phrase and
a password manager like one

792
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:26,220
password, write this phrase down
on a piece of paper, put it in a

793
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:30,300
secure location, memorize it,
whatever you want to do, just

794
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:32,850
make sure you have this backed
up somewhere, I'm just gonna go

795
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:35,640
ahead and hit download this for
now, it's not best practice to

796
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,890
save to your computer, it is
much better to use a password

797
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:40,740
manager or write it down on a
piece of paper or something. So

798
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:44,430
we're gonna go ahead and hit
next. And it's going to ask us

799
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:49,800
to verify that we actually have
it written down. And we're gonna

800
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,920
go ahead and hit confirm, and
great and gives us a couple

801
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:55,800
other tips. Remember, definitely
take these tips very seriously,

802
00:42:55,830 --> 00:42:58,530
especially if you're gonna use
this for real money. Like I

803
00:42:58,530 --> 00:43:01,500
said, For this demo, we're just
going to use test money. So it's

804
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:04,080
not as big of a deal. But if you
put real money in, you

805
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:08,040
absolutely need to backup this
seed phrase or secret phrase or

806
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:11,700
we're going to refer to it as
our pneumonic phrase. Awesome.

807
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:16,080
Now we can see the interface of
our wallet here full screen. And

808
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:19,410
depending on your browser, you
can actually come up and pin it

809
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:22,080
to your browser so that you can
just click it up in the top

810
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:25,620
right, and it'll drop down and
you can see the same interface

811
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:29,310
here our pneumonic phrase that
secret phrase, those that secret

812
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:33,420
12 words that they gave us have
given us access to a new

813
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:36,810
account, the address of our
account is located right here.

814
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:41,160
In fact, if we click it and copy
it to our clipboard, and go to a

815
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:45,420
tool called a block explorer
called ether scan, we can

816
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:49,020
actually paste our address in
here and see details about our

817
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:52,050
account. Ether scan, like I
said, is what's known as a block

818
00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:55,920
Explorer. And it's a way to view
different addresses transactions

819
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:59,550
and other happenings that happen
with a blockchain. If we look at

820
00:43:59,550 --> 00:44:02,760
this address that we just
created on ether scan for

821
00:44:02,790 --> 00:44:06,420
Etherium main net, we can see no
transactions have happened.

822
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:09,660
There's really no analytics,
there's no comments, there's no

823
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:13,440
balance, there's no value,
because it's a brand new wallet,

824
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:16,800
and this address that we just
punched into ether scan

825
00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:21,450
represents our unique address
our unique wallet only

826
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:25,080
identifiable for us. We'll talk
about ether scan a little bit

827
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:27,510
more in a bit because it's a
tool that we're going to use

828
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:30,840
quite often in wallets like meta
mask, you can actually even

829
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:34,980
click right here and create even
more accounts. So let's go ahead

830
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:37,230
and create a new account. We'll
call this

831
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,570
account two.

832
00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:44,850
As you can see, this one has a
different address. So if we

833
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:49,020
click this one, we go back to
ether scan. We paste the address

834
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:53,460
in here. We hit Enter. We can
see another address again that's

835
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:57,930
uniquely identifiable to us,
right here. It is zero balance,

836
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:01,530
no value, no transactions now If
we go back to our Metamask, and

837
00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:04,500
we click the little button, we
can see we have two different

838
00:45:04,530 --> 00:45:07,710
accounts in here, it's the same.
If we hit the extension in the

839
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:12,600
top right, click the button, we
have two different accounts. The

840
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:16,920
12 word secret recovery phrase
allows us to create multiple

841
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:20,640
accounts, all with the same
secret recovery phrase. So that

842
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:24,090
secret recovery phrase will give
us access to both account one

843
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:28,350
and account two and any other
accounts that we create by

844
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:30,990
hitting this Create Account
button, because it gives you

845
00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:34,770
access to all the accounts in
your meta mask. Now, these

846
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:38,490
addresses of both of our
accounts are the public unique

847
00:45:38,490 --> 00:45:43,380
identifiers, but they also have
a private unique identifier only

848
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:48,000
identifiable to us. Similar to
the pneumonic, these are private

849
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,330
identifiers we never want to
share and we never want to give

850
00:45:51,330 --> 00:45:55,470
out their private This is known
as your accounts private key. So

851
00:45:55,470 --> 00:45:58,050
the mnemonic will give you
access over many of these

852
00:45:58,050 --> 00:46:01,140
accounts, the private key will
give you access to just one of

853
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:04,500
these accounts, we can see it by
hitting these little three dots,

854
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:08,520
going to account details and
export private key, you'll just

855
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:12,090
have to punch in your password
here. And you'll be able to see

856
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:16,920
your private key. This is going
to be your private key for your

857
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:19,890
account, you can think of your
private key as a password for

858
00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:23,100
your account that lets you
create transactions. Now the

859
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:26,400
reason that I'm showing mine on
screen is because I'm not going

860
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,770
to put any real money in here.
And this is just going to be a

861
00:46:28,770 --> 00:46:32,430
burner account for this
tutorial. And I highly recommend

862
00:46:32,430 --> 00:46:35,580
once again, you use a burner
account, you use accounts that

863
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:38,850
you never put any real money
into. And along the way, I'll

864
00:46:38,850 --> 00:46:42,240
show you how to make sure that
you don't do that. But normally,

865
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:45,600
it's not a good idea to show or
share your private keys or your

866
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:49,110
secret recovery phrase, if
somebody gets a hold of this

867
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:52,830
private key, they will have
access to my account one.

868
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:57,090
However, they won't have access
to my account to if they get a

869
00:46:57,090 --> 00:47:00,960
hold of my 12 word recovery
phrase or pneumonic they'll have

870
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:04,560
access to both accounts. And
this is why when people say keep

871
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,860
your private keys safe, your
keys, your Bitcoin, your keys,

872
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:11,190
your Aetherium, they're talking
about both your mnemonics or

873
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:15,090
your secret recovery phrases.
And your private keys keep those

874
00:47:15,090 --> 00:47:19,080
private, your public addresses
are totally public. And anybody

875
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:22,350
can view your accounts on
something like ether scan, or

876
00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:25,860
any other explore. And it's
totally okay for people to share

877
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:28,740
their public addresses. If you
lose your private key, you lose

878
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:31,320
access to one of your accounts.
If you lose your mnemonic, you

879
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:34,470
could potentially lose access to
all your accounts. Basically,

880
00:47:34,470 --> 00:47:37,710
what I'm trying to say is back
these up and keep them in safe

881
00:47:37,710 --> 00:47:41,430
places for this course it's okay
if you lose one, since we're not

882
00:47:41,430 --> 00:47:44,430
putting any real money in them.
But in the real world, be sure

883
00:47:44,430 --> 00:47:46,710
to do this. And great. Those are
some of the main security

884
00:47:46,710 --> 00:47:49,890
considerations here. Now, if you
look up in the top right, right

885
00:47:49,890 --> 00:47:52,590
next to that account button that
we've been clicking, you also

886
00:47:52,590 --> 00:47:57,240
see this thing saying Etherium
main net, this is our networks

887
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:00,930
tab. And if we click it, we can
see a list of all the different

888
00:48:00,930 --> 00:48:05,520
networks that we currently have
access to a Etherium main net is

889
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:09,630
the main network of Aetherium.
And this is where real money is

890
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:13,440
spent and used for transactions.
For this course, we're not going

891
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,930
to be working with the Etherium
main net, we're instead going to

892
00:48:15,930 --> 00:48:18,570
be working with something called
a test net. Since we're

893
00:48:18,570 --> 00:48:22,380
engineers, oftentimes, we're
going to want to test and see

894
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:25,410
what our code is actually going
to do and how to interact with

895
00:48:25,410 --> 00:48:28,650
it. We're going to use a
combination of local networks

896
00:48:28,650 --> 00:48:32,460
and test networks to actually do
this to actually test our smart

897
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:35,370
contracts. We're mainly going to
use local networks. But we'll

898
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:38,400
get to that in a little bit to
see some of the test networks

899
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:42,240
that come default with meta
mask, we hit show slash hide

900
00:48:42,270 --> 00:48:45,360
test networks, this will bring
us into the settings page. And

901
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:48,690
we just hit select this to show
test networks in the list. And

902
00:48:48,690 --> 00:48:52,590
we just hit on Now if we scroll
back up, we'll close out of the

903
00:48:52,590 --> 00:48:57,060
settings, we hit the network's
tab again. Now we can see all of

904
00:48:57,060 --> 00:49:01,590
these other networks here like
ropsten, Koven, Rinkeby, and

905
00:49:01,590 --> 00:49:04,800
Garelli. These test networks or
networks that resemble

906
00:49:04,830 --> 00:49:08,190
Aetherium, or polygon, or
Avalanche or phantom or any of

907
00:49:08,190 --> 00:49:11,430
these other blockchains. And we
can actually switch our accounts

908
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:15,000
to one of these other test
networks. Let's click rink B,

909
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,390
for example, we can see that on
the Rinkeby test network. We

910
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:22,500
also have zero Aetherium we have
no money or nothing in here, we

911
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:26,220
have a blank Rinkeby wallet.
These test nets work nearly

912
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:29,580
identical to how Aetherium main
networks except for they run

913
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:33,150
with not real money. They run
with fake money as a way for us

914
00:49:33,150 --> 00:49:36,270
to learn and interact and see
how these different smart

915
00:49:36,270 --> 00:49:39,780
contracts actually work together
at the time of filming. rink B

916
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:43,740
is one of the most popular test
networks along with COVID. So

917
00:49:43,770 --> 00:49:47,670
we're going to work a lot with
Rigby In this tutorial, however,

918
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:51,720
be absolutely sure to check our
GitHub repository to make sure

919
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:55,380
that you're always up to date
with the best test network for

920
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:57,870
following along with the
tutorial here since their test

921
00:49:57,870 --> 00:50:00,360
networks people are running them
out of the goodness of their

922
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:03,810
hearts. And sometimes the best
ones actually change so, so be

923
00:50:03,810 --> 00:50:06,720
sure to follow along with the
GitHub repository. We might also

924
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:10,050
use COVID From time to time or
maybe even Grilli. So we're

925
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:12,360
going to show you how to use a
couple of these different test

926
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:15,720
nets. In fact, if we go to the
GitHub repo associated with this

927
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:19,740
course, we can see recommended
test net is indeed currently

928
00:50:19,770 --> 00:50:22,170
ranking. So that's what we're
going to work with should this

929
00:50:22,170 --> 00:50:25,020
change, you should be able to
follow along with another test.

930
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:28,500
And we'll leave notes as to how
to continue. Now what we can do

931
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:32,850
actually is we can go to Rigby
ether scan, we can go to,

932
00:50:34,530 --> 00:50:37,020
you can look up Rinku ether
scan, and it looks like it's the

933
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:41,640
first thing that shows up
Rinkeby dot ether scan.io, we

934
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:47,070
can punch in this same address,
copy and paste it. And we can

935
00:50:47,070 --> 00:50:50,610
see some of the details of this
address on the Rinkeby ether

936
00:50:50,610 --> 00:50:53,970
scan. Like I said, right now,
it's totally blank. This

937
00:50:53,970 --> 00:50:57,300
networks interface later on is
also how we're going to be able

938
00:50:57,300 --> 00:51:00,810
to work with polygon, avalanche,
etc, we'll just have to add

939
00:51:00,810 --> 00:51:03,840
networks. But we'll get to that
in a bit. And just to reiterate,

940
00:51:03,840 --> 00:51:06,990
test nets are free and for
testing our smart contracts and

941
00:51:06,990 --> 00:51:11,250
main net networks cost money and
are considered live. Now I also

942
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:14,460
do want to put a caveat here
that we do want to keep in mind

943
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:17,700
that these test nets are being
run at the goodness of people's

944
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:20,700
hearts. So we don't want to
abuse them, we want to use them

945
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:23,940
to learn and then move on. So
try not to send a billion

946
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:26,790
transactions on one of these
test nets. In fact, what we're

947
00:51:26,790 --> 00:51:30,000
going to do right now is we're
going to send a transaction on

948
00:51:30,030 --> 00:51:33,750
the Rinkeby test net. And this
will show us exactly what it

949
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:36,630
would look like on a main
network. In order for us to

950
00:51:36,630 --> 00:51:39,150
simulate one of these
transactions, we're going to go

951
00:51:39,150 --> 00:51:42,480
to what's called a faucet. And
if you go to the GitHub

952
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:45,690
repository associated with this
course, right underneath the

953
00:51:45,690 --> 00:51:49,260
recommended test net is going to
be a test net faucets, which is

954
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:53,280
going to show us where the most
up to date faucet location is

955
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:56,250
for us getting test net
Aetherium. So here we are at

956
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:59,910
faucets dot chain dot link,
which again is the recommended

957
00:51:59,910 --> 00:52:03,570
faucet, and what we can do is we
can actually put our wallet

958
00:52:03,570 --> 00:52:08,550
address in and get some test net
link or test net Aetherium. Now

959
00:52:08,550 --> 00:52:11,310
what we are gonna have to do is
we are gonna have to connect our

960
00:52:11,310 --> 00:52:15,180
wallet to the Rinkeby network.
So we're going to come down,

961
00:52:15,870 --> 00:52:21,630
we're going to switch from COVID
to Etherium. Rigby, and then

962
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:25,920
we're going to make sure our
meta mask is on the Rinkeby test

963
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:28,980
network here. Once both of those
are set up, we're gonna go ahead

964
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:32,370
and hit Connect wallet. And
we're going to choose meta mask.

965
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:36,720
Once we do that, our meta mask
is actually going to pop up and

966
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:40,020
say would you like to connect to
this website, connecting to a

967
00:52:40,020 --> 00:52:43,230
website is how we give these
websites in interface to

968
00:52:43,230 --> 00:52:46,560
interact with our wallets and
interact with our meta masks.

969
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:49,710
Don't worry, we're not sending
any transactions like this,

970
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:52,830
we'll get to that in a bit. So
we just we can pick an account

971
00:52:52,830 --> 00:52:56,610
we want to connect. Let's choose
our account one, we'll hit Next.

972
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,330
And then we'll go ahead and
connect. Now that we're

973
00:53:00,330 --> 00:53:04,200
connected, we can actually see
our account connected up here.

974
00:53:04,290 --> 00:53:07,860
And that little warning is now
gone. And our wallet address is

975
00:53:07,890 --> 00:53:10,950
automatically placed into here,
we're going to make our first

976
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:15,030
test transaction. And for now,
we don't need test link. So

977
00:53:15,030 --> 00:53:17,610
we're going to leave that off.
But later on, we're going to

978
00:53:17,610 --> 00:53:20,520
come back and get that test
link. For now we're just going

979
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:22,740
to need 0.1 test Aetherium.

980
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:27,420
So let's go ahead and complete
the security by choosing the

981
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:31,770
traffic lights. And we're going
to hit Send Request. What this

982
00:53:31,770 --> 00:53:37,290
is going to do is we're asking
this faucet to send us 0.1 test

983
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:41,430
Aetherium test net faucets are
ways for us to get money into

984
00:53:41,430 --> 00:53:44,580
our wallets on a test net. And
this is why this test and

985
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:47,730
Aetherium isn't worth any actual
money. Since we can get it for

986
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:51,930
free. These don't exist on Main
net, you can't get real

987
00:53:51,930 --> 00:53:55,440
Aetherium or real money for free
on a main network. So we're on

988
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:58,320
Rinkeby we're getting fake
Rinckey Aetherium. And we're

989
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:00,780
gonna go ahead and hit send
request. Once we hit Send

990
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:04,830
Request, this transaction hash
is going to pop up here, and it

991
00:54:04,830 --> 00:54:07,500
says transactions have been
initiated waiting for

992
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:11,100
confirmation. This means that
some other wallet is actually

993
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:15,720
going to send us 0.1 test eath.
And this is the transaction that

994
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:18,600
it's doing to do that now we
just have to wait for our

995
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:22,080
transaction to finish verifying
and finish going through. Now if

996
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:24,540
this doesn't work right away, I
would recommend Wait a minute

997
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:27,270
and then just try it again. But
what we can do is we can click

998
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:31,020
this transaction hash. If that
transaction doesn't show up, we

999
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:35,940
can also just close this. And we
can copy our address here. And

1000
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:39,900
actually we already see 0.1 eath
in our wallets here. But we can
